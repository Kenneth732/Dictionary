Of course! Let's break down the `print_nested_dict` function step by step:

1. `def print_nested_dict(d, indent=0):`

   - `def` is used to define a function in Python. We name our function `print_nested_dict`.
   - Inside the parentheses, we have two parameters: `d` and `indent`. `d` represents the dictionary we want to print, and `indent` is a variable used to control the level of indentation for a clearer display.

2. `for key, value in d.items():`

   - This is a for loop that iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary `d`. `key` represents the key (e.g., 'firstName'), and `value` represents the corresponding value (e.g., 'Dean').

3. `if isinstance(value, dict):`

   - Here, we check if the current `value` is an instance of a dictionary. If it is, it means we have a nested dictionary to print.

4. `print(f'{" " * indent}{key}:')`

   - This line prints the current `key` with the appropriate level of indentation. We use string formatting (`f-string`) to include the `key` and add spaces before it based on the `indent` variable.

5. `print_nested_dict(value, indent + 2)`

   - Now, we call the `print_nested_dict` function recursively with the current `value` as the new dictionary to print. We also increase the `indent` by 2 to create a nested appearance in the output.

6. `elif isinstance(value, list):`

   - If the current `value` is not a dictionary, we check if it's a list. Lists might contain nested dictionaries or other types of data.

7. `print(f'{" " * indent}{key}:')`

   - Similar to step 4, we print the current `key` with the appropriate indentation.

8. `for item in value:`

   - Here, we iterate over the items in the current `value`, which is a list.

9. `if isinstance(item, dict):`

   - Within the list, we check if the current `item` is a dictionary.

10. `print_nested_dict(item, indent + 2)`

    - If it is a dictionary, we call the `print_nested_dict` function recursively on that `item` with increased indentation.

11. `else:`

    - If the current `item` within the list is not a dictionary (i.e., it's a simple value), we print it directly with the appropriate indentation.

12. `else:`

    - If the current `value` is neither a dictionary nor a list, it means it's a simple value (e.g., string, integer, boolean).

13. `print(f'{" " * indent}{key}: {value}')`

    - In this case, we print both the `key` and the `value` together with the appropriate indentation.

The function works recursively, which means it can handle nested dictionaries and lists of dictionaries at multiple levels. It adds indentation to the output for better visualization of the hierarchical structure.
